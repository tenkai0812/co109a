// Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
// i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed. 
// When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes
// "white" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.

// Put your code here.

//24576---->keyboard
